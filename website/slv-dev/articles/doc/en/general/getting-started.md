## The Toolkit for Solana Devs

SLV is a toolkit for Solana developers. It provides a set of tools to help
developers build, test, and deploy Solana Validators and Solana-based
applications.

In the newly revamped slv, you can complete all configurations from a remote
machine—no more direct node logins required. This approach ensures that only
essential packages are installed on the node, leaving behind no unnecessary
clutter. We’ve also introduced Ansible Playbooks & Jinja Template for Linux
configuration, allowing us to manage and migrate multiple validators with
greater efficiency and security.

Additionally, the new SLV always uses a dummy key (an invalid key named
“unstaked-identity.json”) for its initial startup. Once you confirm everything
is running smoothly, you simply set the actual Identity and switch to the active
key. Following this consistent flow helps prevent double votes and ensures
you’re prepared in case the node ever becomes unreachable.
