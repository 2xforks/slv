Epics DAO has announced a token burn plan for its community utility token,
$EPCT.

## $EPCT Token Economy and Token Burn Plan

According to the Epics token burn plan, 33% of Epics platform fees will be
burned. The maximum supply of EPCT tokens is 1 billion, but the burn will reduce
their token supply to 100 million.

In general, when the supply of tokens decreases and the demand stays the same,
it creates upward pressure on the token price. Epics platform fees are mainly
generated when creating quests and clearing quests, but by burning tokens there,
you can expect quest achievements on the platform and an increase in token
prices.

For Hodlers (investors who hold tokens without selling them), the value of their
tokens rises relatively due to burns, so EPCT tokens are not only for use, but
also an incentive to own them.

It is hoped that this will gain the attention, understanding, and support of
those who are not normally involved in open source development, and at the same
time, create a win-win relationship, making the open source development market
more sustainable and robust.

## Open source development is facing a serious resource shortage as it becomes more important every day

![Market Trends](/news/2023/01/23/MarketTrends.png)
![Problem](/news/2023/01/23/Problem.png)

In 2022, 78% of all codebases were open source software. In this 12 years, the
use of open source software in the software development field has suddenly
become an industry standard. It's no exaggeration to say that open source
software is essential to modern innovation.

However, since contributions to open source development are still basically free
of charge, open source development is causing a serious shortage of resources as
the importance of open source software increases day by day.

On the other hand, there are many developers who want to devote their lives to
open source software development.

We are working to solve this resource imbalance problem with the power of Web3
token economy.

## Epics - Decentralized Crowdsourcing Platform

![Epics](/news/2022/07/19/EpicsBusinessModelEN.png)

Epics is a decentralized crowdsourcing platform for incentivizing open source
software development.

Clients can set up a GitHub issue as a Quest (Smart Contract). Developers can
receive token prizes by solving issues (quests).

This ecosystem makes developers focus on problems in their expertise. Also,
clients will be able to solve more advanced problems.

The more token prizes, the more attention to be solved issues. As a result, open
source software grows faster in quality.

Epics solves resource imbalances in software development.

For developers, we can realize a world where they can fully demonstrate and
develop their own skills, and for clients, we can realize a world where they can
develop higher quality open source software and use open source software more
safely.

We would like to contribute to the development of open source software as a more
reliable, high-quality global software asset.
