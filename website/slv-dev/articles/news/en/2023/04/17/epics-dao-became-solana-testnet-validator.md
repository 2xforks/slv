Epics DAO has announced that it participates as a validator to contribute to the
Solana blockchain's high-speed and stable decentralized network.

The Epics DAO is already a validator on the Solana chain testnet. In 2024, it
will be a mainnet validator.

## Solana Blockchain Validator

The popularity of the Solana blockchain is due to its speed and scalability.

Solana can process thousands of transactions per second (tens of thousands are
theoretically possible and getting faster daily) much quicker than many other
blockchain platforms. Solana employs a new consensus algorithm called Proof of
History (PoH). PoH is designed for short block generation and high throughput,
which is one of the reasons why Solana is more rapid than other blockchains.

Solana is expected to be used in many fields, such as his DeFi and NFT, and new
projects appear one after another on Solana. As a result, the Solana ecosystem
continues to grow, and many people are paying attention to it.

Validators in Solana are responsible for verifying the validity of transactions
on the Solana blockchain and performing the computations necessary to generate
new blocks. This is a role similar to that of Bitcoin and Ethereum miners. As a
result, Solana validators play a vital role in maintaining network stability and
security.

Epics DAO will do its best as a validator to contribute to developing the Solana
chain.

## Epics - The Buidlers Guild

80% of the current software (including commercial) source code worldwide is
open. Most software today is based on open-source software. However, open-source
development is free of charge and is not a sustainable environment.

To make open source development sustainable, the existence of capital
(Investor), development resources (Dev), and public relations (Degen) that
inform the current situation and gather collaborators is indispensable. Good
cooperation among these three parties will enable further open-source
development. As open source development develops, the software that depends on
it will benefit, and society will become more convenient.

Epics aims to create a sustainable open-source development environment powered
by gamification and his Web3 token economy.
