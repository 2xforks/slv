Two years ago, we moved to the Netherlands and was devoted to researching
software and blockchain, but the other day we finally succeeded in developing
their own cryptocurrency (token), and for the purpose of announcing it and
sharing technology we participated in Solana Hacker House in Paris from 15th to
19th July.

Now that the cryptocurrencies (tokens) and NFTs we develop have been registered
on the Solana blockchain, anyone in the world can buy and transfer our tokens.

## Decentralized Crowdsourcing Platform

We are using this Solana blockchain network to build a "Decentralized
Crowdsourcing Platform" for open source software development.

Open source software is now an integral part of almost every company due to
innovation, but it's free to use.

Today, quite a few engineers continue to improve open source software, but only
a handful of them are rewarded, and most engineers continue to develop at the
expense of leisure and strength.

On the other hand, corporate engineers cannot devote all their resources to
development. Good development resources are being used to recruit organizations.
There is an engineering resource mismatch for the development we really need.

There is an overwhelming shortage of engineering resources to meet the
ever-increasing quantitative and qualitative demand for open source software.

We solve this problem by building a Decentralized Crowdsourcing Platform and
providing appropriate incentives for open source software development.

Increase the speed and quality of open source software development by creating
an ecosystem where more engineers can participate in and reward open source
software problem solving, and all organizations benefit from software
development.
