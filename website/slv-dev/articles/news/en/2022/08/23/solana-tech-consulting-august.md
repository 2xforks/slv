ELAOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands; President: Fumitake
Kawasaki) will hold a joint venture from August 23 to the end of August 2022 to
develop new Web3 services using the high-speed, low-cost Solana blockchain.
Regarding technical consulting, we have started recruiting limited 2 groups (5%
OFF).

## Solana blockchain

Solana is the fastest blockchain in the world and the fastest growing ecosystem
in crypto, with thousands of projects spanning DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and more.

The main issues with Web3 (blockchain) apps were slow transactions (30 minutes
to 1 hour) and high transaction fees (thousands of yen), but Solana has
succeeded in making significant improvements in these two areas. Transactions
are completed in seconds and fees are less than $0.01.

Solana's speed and low cost have contributed to innovations in De-Fi, such as
board trading, and greatly improving the user experience of Web3 apps.

### The fastest blockchain

Solana is all about speed, with 400 millisecond block times. And as hardware
gets faster, so does the network. Speeding up has a positive impact on the user
experience.

### Low transaction costs

Solana's scalability ensures transactions remain less than $0.01 for both
developers and users. Blockchain innovation needs to be low transaction costs to
spread.

### Decentralized and unstoppable

Not only is Solana ultra-fast and low cost, it is censorship resistant. Meaning,
the network will remain open for applications to run freely and transactions
will never be stopped.

## Web3 development and consulting

We can support Solana blockchain and Web3-related development in various ways.
Please feel free to contact us by email.

\*Technical consulting in August is limited to two groups, and a 5% discount
campaign is underway.
