## About Epics DAO

![Epics Platform NFT Card Game](/news/2023/12/01/EpicsPlatformEN.png)

In recent years, high-quality open-source software, essentially free, has grown
to be adopted by 97% of companies. However, many projects, being
volunteer-driven, often fail to be properly maintained due to financial
difficulties or lack of resources. As a result, more than half of the software
worldwide faces serious security risks.

The Epics platform integrates three key resources for projects: development,
funding, and PR, in a new way. This platform promotes collaboration among
community members with different roles, such as developers, investors, and
public relations activists. The goal is to strengthen support for open-source
software development, achieve sustainable development, global software security,
and further improve quality.

In the new economic system implemented by Epics in society, different coin
rewards are offered based on the user's contribution method (there are three
types of jobs: development/investment/PR). The types of NFT cards that can be
earned also vary by job, creating an environment where users with different
roles support each other's achievements. Each can enjoy their favorite part as
much as they want, whether it's acquiring and opening card packs, trading cards
and packs in the market, or participating in tournaments.

Playing and enjoying on the platform creates a sustainable environment for
open-source development and contributes to solving social issues. This is the
initiative of Epics DAO. Everyone is welcome to cooperate in various ways. We
look forward to your participation. For more information, please check the
official Discord.
