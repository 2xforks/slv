## About Epics DAO

![Epics Plaform NFT Card Game](/news/2023/12/01/EpicsPlatformEN.png)

In recent years, high-quality open-source software, provided mostly for free,
has been adopted by 97% of companies. However, many projects are
volunteer-driven, leading to funding and resource shortages that often result in
inadequate maintenance. As a result, more than half of the world's software is
at serious security risk.

The Epics platform integrates three crucial resources for projects: development,
funding, and PR, in a new way. This platform promotes collaboration among
community members with different roles, such as developers, investors, and
public relations activists. The goal is to strengthen support for open-source
software development, ensuring sustainable development, global software
security, and further quality improvement.

Epics introduces a new economic system that provides different coin rewards
based on the user's contribution method (development, investment, PR), offering
various NFT cards according to the job. This environment encourages users with
different roles to support each other's achievements. Users can enjoy obtaining
and opening card packs, trading cards and packs in the market, and participating
in competitions as they like.

Playing and enjoying on the platform creates a sustainable open-source
development environment and contributes to solving social issues, realizing a
virtuous cycle. This is the effort of Epics DAO. Everyone can cooperate in
various ways in this initiative. We look forward to your participation. For more
details, please check the official Discord.
