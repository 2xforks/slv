Thank you always for your support.

Currently, we are focusing on developing the staking functionality for BDLC.

As special advance information, we will briefly explain the rules for BDLC
staking. Those who read this article in early are in luck.

BDLC NFTs will soon be able to be staked in support of open-source projects.

Staking rewards, equivalent to the NFT's Total Rarity x 1 in $EPCT and Investor
Coins, will accumulate every 24 hours (ownership checks and calculations are
performed every 2 hours).

Staking rewards can be claimed at any time, though a small fee applies (0.001
SOL). At the time of claiming, an amount of $EPCT equivalent to your rewards
will be sent to the open-source project's multisig treasury, and stakers will be
etched into the chain as contributors to the project.

Additionally, there are parts bonuses for this staking, with the currently
revealed ones as follows:

- Rainbow Part - $EPCT reward bonus of Total Rarity x2
- Pipe - $EPCT reward bonus of Total Rarity x1.5
- Alien - $EPCT reward bonus of Total Rarity x1.5
- VR - $EPCT reward bonus of Total Rarity x1.5

## About Epics DAO

![Epics Plaform NFT Card Game](/news/2023/12/01/EpicsPlatformEN.png)

In recent years, high-quality open-source software, provided mostly for free,
has been adopted by 97% of companies. However, many projects are
volunteer-driven, leading to funding and resource shortages that often result in
inadequate maintenance. As a result, more than half of the world's software is
at serious security risk.

The Epics platform integrates three crucial resources for projects: development,
funding, and PR, in a new way. This platform promotes collaboration among
community members with different roles, such as developers, investors, and
public relations activists. The goal is to strengthen support for open-source
software development, ensuring sustainable development, global software
security, and further quality improvement.

Epics introduces a new economic system that provides different coin rewards
based on the user's contribution method (development, investment, PR), offering
various NFT cards according to the job. This environment encourages users with
different roles to support each other's achievements. Users can enjoy obtaining
and opening card packs, trading cards and packs in the market, and participating
in competitions as they like.

Playing and enjoying on the platform creates a sustainable open-source
development environment and contributes to solving social issues, realizing a
virtuous cycle. This is the effort of Epics DAO. Everyone can cooperate in
various ways in this initiative. We look forward to your participation. For more
details, please check the official Discord.
