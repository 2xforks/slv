ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, The Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) is pleased to announce the launch of “FastPass”, offering priority access to dedicated Solana nodes. This initiative addresses the growing user demand to test both Standard and Premium nodes for optimal configuration, thereby enabling a more flexible and regret-free start to projects.

## Background of FastPass Introduction

- **Difficulty in Selecting the Right Specifications**  
  Merely looking at hardware specs such as CPU and RAM often makes it challenging for users to determine whether their requirements can truly be met. For instance, questions like “Will I really achieve zero-block latency?” or “Is a standard node sufficient for my performance needs?” frequently arise, underscoring the strong demand for real-world testing.

- **Global Hardware Shortages**  
  High-spec components required for Solana nodes (e.g., DDR5 RAM, the latest AMD CPUs) are currently in short supply worldwide. Newly procured hardware often sells out immediately, leaving some users without the opportunity to complete their tests before stock runs out.

## Overview of FastPass

To address these challenges, we have introduced the **“FastPass”** service. By purchasing FastPass, users gain the following benefits:

1. **Priority Node Allocation**  
   Dedicated nodes often sell out rapidly due to high demand. With FastPass, you receive priority access, ensuring sufficient inventory during the testing phase and greatly reducing the risk of node shortages.

2. **Testing Both Standard and Premium Nodes**  
   Users can try out both Standard Dedicated Nodes and Zero-Block Premium Dedicated Nodes, working with experts to evaluate performance. This allows you to clearly determine **which option best meets your needs** before moving to production.

3. **Billing Starts Only After Finalizing Your Configuration**  
   You can switch to a production environment only once you verify that the selected configuration meets your requirements, ensuring a **regret-free choice** and a well-prepared project launch.

## Types of FastPass

We are introducing two types of FastPass, both of which provide priority node allocation, access to test environments, and expert support.

### FastPass for Dedicated RPC/gRPC

- Compare and evaluate Standard Dedicated RPC/gRPC and Zero-Block Premium Dedicated RPC/gRPC
- Collaborate with experts on hardware specifications and optimal configurations
- Begin production only after arriving at a setup that fully meets your needs

### FastPass for Zero-Distance Bare Metal

- Secure priority access to dedicated bare-metal nodes, with “zero-distance” connections to RPC nodes
- Achieve theoretically the lowest possible latency while thoroughly testing performance with expert guidance
- Receive comprehensive support for hardware procurement, configuration, and optimization

FastPass is available for purchase on the official Validators DAO Discord server.

## Future Outlook

ELSOUL LABO B.V. will continue to strengthen its hardware procurement processes for performance nodes optimized for Solana, ensuring that users can seamlessly access dedicated nodes. We also plan to further expand our global data center footprint and continually refine node configurations, aiming to provide a **high-performance platform** for an ever-growing number of projects.
