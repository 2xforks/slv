The WBSO is a Dutch government tax incentive scheme designed to stimulate technological innovation and R&D investment. It provides companies engaged in high-level R&D with reductions in payroll tax and social security contributions, thereby promoting innovation. By receiving this approval for four consecutive years, ELSOUL LABO B.V. can expect the following benefits and impact:

- **Enhanced R&D Infrastructure**  
  Ongoing investment in both internal and external engineering resources maintains a high standard of development in blockchain and open-source domains.
- **Accelerated Innovation**  
  Actively engaging in advanced technology proofs of concept and prototyping to develop globally unique solutions.
- **Increased Global Competitiveness**  
  Collaborating with open-source communities and the Solana ecosystem to strengthen the company’s international reach.

## Three Core Business Domains and Their Synergies

Since its founding, ELSOUL LABO B.V. has been operating around three main business domains. By leveraging the synergies among them, the company fosters innovation and community-driven ecosystem building.

### 1. Solana Blockchain Infrastructure

- **ERPC (Solana Enhanced RPC)**  
  A global-scale RPC service equipped with over 300 edge servers worldwide, delivering low-latency and stable connections. It has garnered strong support from traders requiring high-frequency transactions.

- **Validators Solutions (Automated Solana Validator Operations)**  
  A service that drastically reduces the technical barriers and day-to-day maintenance required to operate validator nodes, enabling anyone to earn rewards while contributing to network security.

- **elSOL (Solana Incentivized LST)**  
  A Liquid Staking Token that provides staking rewards alongside additional incentives. With integrations across various DeFi platforms, it enables higher APYs.

The company operates multiple Solana mainnet validators in-house, using the advanced operational insights gained to develop open-source tools like **SLV** and to collaborate within **Validators DAO**, thereby improving quality and decentralization across the ecosystem. At the same time, ELSOUL LABO B.V. spreads awareness of the importance of high-spec validator operations, looking toward future opportunities for revenue growth.

### 2. Open-Source Software Development

Committed to fostering open-source culture, ELSOUL LABO B.V. publishes its source code and actively collaborates with communities and enterprises worldwide to improve software quality on a global scale.

- **solv**  
  An open-source Solana validator operations tool covering node setup, monitoring, updates, and more, all in one place. By simplifying these operations, solv promotes greater network decentralization and security.

- **Skeet (Edge-Native Web Framework)**  
  A full-stack framework enabling deployment across edge servers worldwide, ensuring rapid responses. It integrates Web3 functionalities with ease, offering a familiar development experience.

- **SLV (The Tool for Solana Devs)**  
  Combining the strengths of solv and Skeet, SLV offers a seamless, all-in-one development environment for Solana validators and applications. A future “SLV Cloud” is planned, running applications within Solana-optimized global edge data centers to achieve theoretically the fastest possible Solana communications.

### 3. DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

ELSOUL LABO B.V. leverages DAO-based governance and token economics to cultivate new forms of social value creation.

- **Epics DAO**  
  Merging competitive NFT trading card gaming with support for open-source development, Epics DAO provides an incentive model where players can continuously fund OSS while enjoying gameplay. This goes beyond mere donations, aiming for a sustainable OSS ecosystem.

- **Validators DAO**  
  A community dedicated to enhancing the decentralization and security of the Solana network. Members share knowledge about validator operations and the latest updates, collectively elevating the overall ecosystem quality.

Insights gleaned from these DAO initiatives are continually funneled back into ELSOUL LABO B.V. products, forming a virtuous cycle that drives steady improvements in software quality and user experience. By embracing transparent and flexible governance, the company aims to set new standards in the Web3 era.

## Future Outlook

With the research and development benefits of the WBSO approval and its community-driven innovation, ELSOUL LABO B.V. will further accelerate the following initiatives:

- **Deepening Advanced Technologies**  
  Exploring new use cases that harness Solana and Web3 technologies on a global scale.
- **Broader Contributions to the Open-Source Ecosystem**  
  Strengthening community collaborations on core projects like SLV, and establishing sustainable incentive models for OSS through DAO frameworks.
- **Enhanced Integration with Global Edge Data Centers**  
  Implementing a Solana-focused global edge infrastructure—“SLV Cloud”—in future data centers, ensuring seamless, high-speed communication between blockchain networks and applications.

ELSOUL LABO B.V. continues to maximize the potential of blockchain and open-source software. By openly sharing R&D outcomes and engaging diverse stakeholders, the company aims to establish new infrastructure standards for the Web3 era, propelling global innovation to new heights.
