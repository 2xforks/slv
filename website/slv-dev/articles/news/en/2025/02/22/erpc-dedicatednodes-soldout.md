ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, the Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) recently announced that it has added new regions and conducted a large-scale infrastructure upgrade for its Solana Enhanced RPC service, **ERPC**. As part of this expansion, **hundreds of Solana nodes** were deployed worldwide. However, due to overwhelming demand immediately following the service launch, **all dedicated nodes have already sold out**.

## Rapid Growth in Demand

- **Impact of New Locations**  
  By opening new data center locations in Frankfurt (Germany) and Chicago (USA), and strengthening existing high-performance nodes in New York, Amsterdam, and Tokyo, the quality of our service has increased significantly, leading to a rapid rise in user adoption.
- **Experience Industry-Leading Performance**  
  Many users have experienced our high-performance environment—particularly through our free Shared RPC/gRPC service trial—driving usage to scale more than tenfold in a short period.

## Status of Dedicated Node Availability

- **Reasons for Selling Out**  
  In addition to heightened demand, **global shortages of DDR5 RAM and the latest AMD CPUs**—both essential for running Solana nodes—have made it challenging to expand our capacity quickly.
- **Waiting for the Next Restock**  
  We are actively procuring additional hardware and conducting the necessary deployment tests. As soon as the timing of our next restock is confirmed, we will inform those on our waiting list in priority order.

## Continued Availability of Shared RPC/gRPC Services

Even though dedicated nodes are currently sold out, our **Shared RPC/gRPC services** remain fully operational. Thanks to our extensive infrastructure upgrades, we continue to deliver high performance and stability in the shared environment, which many users are already benefiting from.

- **Industry-leading low latency and high throughput**
- **Redundant deployments across multiple regions for reliable uptime**
- **Free tier available for easy trials**

## Future Initiatives

To meet the rapidly growing demand, ELSOUL LABO B.V. will continue to pursue the following efforts:

1. **Enhanced Hardware Procurement**  
   We are strengthening our supply chain to secure the high-spec components required for Solana nodes, including DDR5 RAM and the latest AMD CPUs.
2. **Accelerated Node Deployment and Testing**  
   Our team is swiftly testing and deploying new hardware to ensure that we can promptly serve users who are waiting for dedicated nodes.
3. **Ongoing Global Infrastructure Expansion**  
   We will continue to establish data centers around the world, ensuring low-latency, high-availability service regardless of location.
