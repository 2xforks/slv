ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands; CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) has successfully completed a rigorous review process and has been officially registered as a member of the Regional Internet Registry for Europe (RIPE). With this membership, the company is now able to obtain its own Autonomous System Number (ASN) and IP addresses, enabling the full-scale expansion of global edge data centers optimized for the Solana blockchain and contributing to the further development of decentralized infrastructure.

## Significance of Completing RIPE Registration and Acquiring an ASN

RIPE is a non-profit organization that centrally manages IP addresses and ASNs across Europe.  
By completing its official registration and operating its own ASN and IP addresses, ELSOUL LABO B.V. expects to achieve the following benefits:

- **Independently Operated Network Infrastructure**  
  Build a flexible and stable network connection through its own ASN.

- **Advanced Security Measures**  
  Strengthen the security and decentralization of the Solana network by establishing dedicated routes to global edge data centers.

- **Low-Latency and High-Speed Communication**  
  Provide stable infrastructure for users and node operators worldwide to ensure seamless access from any region.

## Vision for Global Solana Edge Data Centers

Since its establishment, ELSOUL LABO B.V. has focused on three main areas of research and development:

1. **Solana Blockchain Infrastructure**

   - Validator automation service: “Validators Solutions”
   - Global-scale RPC service: “ERPC”
   - Incentivized Liquid Staking Token: “elSOL”

2. **Open-Source Software Development**

   - “solv,” a tool that simplifies validator operations
   - Edge-native web framework “Skeet”
   - “SLV,” an all-in-one development toolchain combining the above tools

3. **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) Initiatives**
   - “Epics DAO,” aiming to create new incentive models for open-source development
   - “Validators DAO,” promoting knowledge sharing among validators and advancing the decentralization of the Solana network

With the independent network infrastructure gained from RIPE registration, the company will further expand synergies across these three core areas. In particular, ELSOUL LABO B.V. plans to leverage global Solana edge data centers so that applications can be hosted in the same racks as its ERPC and validator nodes—ultimately enabling the fastest possible Solana communication environment in theory.

## Future Outlook

- **Acquisition and Operation of an Independent ASN and IP Addresses**  
  Build a proprietary network linking multiple locations around the world to achieve both stability and low latency.

- **Establishing Global Solana Edge Data Centers**  
  Set up high-performance data centers optimized for the Solana mainnet across Europe, North America, and Asia.

- **Strengthening Community Collaboration**  
  Lower the barrier to entry for a wider range of users by sharing know-how on validator operations and by participating in DAO activities.

Through these initiatives, ELSOUL LABO B.V. will further promote and decentralize the Solana blockchain and drive global innovation powered by open-source software.

Committed to continuous research and development of cutting-edge technology and community-driven governance, ELSOUL LABO B.V. will pave the way for a new infrastructure standard in the blockchain era.
