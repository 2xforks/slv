ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands; CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) is pleased to announce the launch of our dedicated bare-metal server solution, **"Tuned Bare-Metal"**, as part of our distributed infrastructure services. Through comprehensive server tuning, this new offering **fully harnesses server resources for low-latency, high-throughput performance**—specifically tailored for Solana validators, RPC nodes, and other high-demand workloads—significantly enhancing transaction speeds and overall operational stability.

## Background and Benefits of “Tuned Bare-Metal” Release

- **Optimization to Fully Utilize Server Resources**  
  In many standard server environments, resource settings are often throttled by default to prioritize stability or reduce costs. However, “Tuned Bare-Metal” employs BIOS-level CPU performance tuning and turbo boost features to unlock the server’s latent capabilities, ensuring stable high-speed processing even during periods of intense demand.

- **Flexible Architecture for Peak Access**  
  By leveraging high-performance proxies and distributing workloads across multiple nodes, we minimize latency even during peak access times. This scalable architecture enables reliable handling of sudden spikes in user numbers or transaction volumes.

- **Optimized for Solana Validators and RPC**  
  Building on our expertise from operating services such as “Solana Enhanced RPC (ERPC)” and the validator automation platform “Validators Solutions,” we’ve incorporated specialized configurations that meet the rigorous demands of Solana nodes. These optimizations notably improve response times and transaction success rates, maintaining top-tier performance under heavy loads.

- **BIOS-Level Optimizations**  
  From CPU performance configurations to unlocked scaling options, we ensure the hardware’s full potential is tapped. Compared to typical bare-metal servers, “Tuned Bare-Metal” leaves no room for underused resources.

- **Purpose-Specific Labeling for Accurate Server Selection**  
  Informed by insights gained from developing and operating the open-source “SLV,” each server undergoes performance testing and is labeled for specific use cases—such as testnet, mainnet, or RPC—so users can easily choose the most suitable configuration for their Solana nodes.

- **Customization and Scalability**  
  We offer flexible upgrade paths and customization options to meet the growing needs of each project. Whether it’s DeFi, NFTs, or GameFi, “Tuned Bare-Metal” reliably supports high-throughput operations while ensuring stable, efficient performance.

## Future Outlook

With the launch of “Tuned Bare-Metal,” ELSOUL LABO further **maximizes server resource utilization** and strengthens our **infrastructure for stable, high-performance operations of Solana validators, RPC nodes, and other demanding workloads**. We will continue to expand our network and pursue research in advanced server tuning to offer a global user base the optimal environment for high performance and low latency.
