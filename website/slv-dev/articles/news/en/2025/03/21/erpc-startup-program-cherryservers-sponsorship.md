ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, The Netherlands; CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) provides the Solana Enhanced RPC service “ERPC,” supported by over 300 edge servers worldwide. We are pleased to announce that **Cherry Servers**, our global data center partner, has joined the **ERPC Startup Program** as a sponsor. As a result, projects can now enjoy a **3-week** free trial of our highly demanded **Dedicated Solana RPC Nodes**.

## What Is the ERPC Startup Program?

“ERPC” (Solana Enhanced RPC) is a global proxy service that automatically selects the nearest edge server to deliver **low-latency, stable connections**. With over 300 locations around the globe, it enables fast and seamless access to Solana dApps, ensuring high performance anywhere in the world.

For many Web3 and Solana projects, performing **production-scale** testing on the real Solana network comes with significant infrastructure costs. To lower these barriers and accelerate crypto adoption, we have been offering **3 months of free access** through the ERPC Startup Program.

## How Cherry Servers’ Sponsorship Strengthens the Program

With **Cherry Servers** now sponsoring the program, in addition to the existing free ERPC resources, participants can take advantage of a **3-week** trial of **Dedicated Solana RPC Nodes**—one of our most popular offerings. Many DeFi projects require **dedicated RPC** setups or specialized network configurations to handle large-scale, globally distributed transactions. This sponsorship lowers the financial and operational barriers that previously stood in the way of such setups.

## Background of the Program

Many Web3 and Solana projects seek to test their solutions under near-production conditions. However, operating RPC nodes that can handle **high-frequency transactions** reliably often incurs substantial server and network costs.

ELSOUL LABO has tackled these challenges by creating ERPC, leveraging a network of **300+ globally distributed edge servers** to provide **low latency and high availability**. With Cherry Servers’ sponsorship, more startups can now **access dedicated nodes and robust infrastructure** at minimal cost, fostering further growth of the Solana ecosystem.
