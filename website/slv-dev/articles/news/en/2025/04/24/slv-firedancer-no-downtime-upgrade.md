ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands; CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) and Validators DAO have officially released a **No-Downtime Upgrade feature** for the open-source Solana validator tool "SLV," specifically targeting Solana mainnet validators.

With this new feature, validator operators can seamlessly upgrade to the latest Firedancer client version or migrate to new servers without any downtime.

### Maximize Revenue Opportunities with Zero Downtime

Typically, validator upgrades or server migrations involve temporary downtime, risking revenue loss and decreased stake in LST pools. The new SLV feature enables dual-node setups and seamless switching, completely mitigating these risks.

- **Prevent Revenue Loss:** Maintain continuous operations to ensure stable revenue.
- **Easy Stake Retention:** Continuous uptime enhances your standing in LST pools, contributing to long-term stake stability.

### Simple Operation, Globally Accessible

SLV's No-Downtime Upgrade feature requires no complicated procedures and can be intuitively managed with simple commands. Moreover, as an open-source solution, developers and operators worldwide can freely utilize and contribute, enhancing the overall reliability of the Solana ecosystem.
