ELSOUL LABO B.V. (headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake
Kawasaki), through its social contribution Web3 NFT card game "Epics DAO",
supports open-source development. We are pleased to announce that "Epics DAO"'s
utility token $EPCT has been newly listed as the "SOL-EPCT" pair on Orca and
Jupiter, the leading DEXes (Decentralized Exchanges) on the Solana blockchain.
This listing expands the trading options available for $EPCT, previously
tradeable as the "USDC-EPCT" pair, enhancing user accessibility.

Firstly, this article is not intended for investment advice. Additionally, the
information provided herein is accurate as of the time of writing. Please verify
the latest information. Always practice NFA/DYOR.

## About the New "SOL-EPCT" Pair Listing

On the Solana blockchain's DEXes, Orca and Jupiter, known for their significant
trading volumes, a new currency pair "$EPCT" has been listed as "SOL-EPCT". This
diversifies the trading options for $EPCT, improving user accessibility.
Traditionally, acquiring tokens on the Solana blockchain involved purchasing
SOL, which then had to be exchanged for USDC before buying $EPCT. However, with
the listing of the new "SOL-EPCT" pair, it is now possible to directly exchange
SOL for $EPCT, enabling users to trade $EPCT more efficiently and at lower
costs.

Thanks to your support, $EPCT celebrated its 1-year anniversary of the IDO
listing at the end of January 2024. The growth rate of the "USDC-EPCT" LP
(Liquidity Pool) has reached +137%, leading to the new currency pair listing.

We will continue to offer more new features and events aimed at the growth of
our platform. We appreciate your continued support for Epics DAO.

## About Epics DAO

![Epics Platform NFT Card Game](/news/2023/12/01/EpicsPlatformEN.png)

In recent years, high-quality open-source software, essentially free, has grown
to be adopted by 97% of companies. However, many projects, being
volunteer-driven, often fail to be properly maintained due to financial
difficulties or lack of resources. As a result, more than half of the software
worldwide faces serious security risks.

The Epics platform integrates three key resources for projects: development,
funding, and PR, in a new way. This platform promotes collaboration among
community members with different roles, such as developers, investors, and
public relations activists. The goal is to strengthen support for open-source
software development, achieve sustainable development, global software security,
and further improve quality.

In the new economic system implemented by Epics in society, different coin
rewards are offered based on the user's contribution method (there are three
types of jobs: development/investment/PR). The types of NFT cards that can be
earned also vary by job, creating an environment where users with different
roles support each other's achievements. Each can enjoy their favorite part as
much as they want, whether it's acquiring and opening card packs, trading cards
and packs in the market, or participating in tournaments.

Playing and enjoying on the platform creates a sustainable environment for
open-source development and contributes to solving social issues. This is the
initiative of Epics DAO. Everyone is welcome to cooperate in various ways. We
look forward to your participation. For more information, please check the Epics
DAO Official Discord.
