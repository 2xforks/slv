Catchphrase: Everyone's a protagonist.

Concept:

1. Fusion of Online and Real
2. Japan's Largest Subculture Festival
3. Creators as the Main Characters

Starting from the concept of "recreating everything (more or less) from Niconico
Douga on the ground," "NICONICO CHOKAIGI" has established itself as a
one-of-a-kind subculture event where net culture is enjoyed in real life. As a
unique "Japanese cultural festival" where everyone can say "I like what I like,"
connecting people and things, that's what NICONICO CHOKAIGI is.

Number of Real Event Visitors (2024): 125,362 people

Epics DAO also exhibited at NICONICO CHOKAIGI 2024, where we hosted the "Super
Dice Roll" event at our booth. This included limited NFT card packs and
merchandise giveaways, culminating in a highly successful event.

We would like to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt thanks to
everyone who participated. Thank you very much.

## Social Issues to be Solved by Epics DAO

In recent years, high-quality open-source software, which is predominantly free,
has been adopted by 97% of companies, showing significant growth. However, as
many projects are volunteer-driven, they often suffer from financial
difficulties or a lack of resources, leading to inadequate maintenance.
Consequently, over half of the software globally is at risk due to serious
security vulnerabilities.

The Epics platform addresses this issue by providing appropriate incentives for
development, funding, and PR - three crucial resources for projects. It promotes
collaboration among community members with different roles, such as developers,
investors, and marketing activists, with the aim of enhancing support for
open-source software development, ensuring sustainable development, global
software security, and further improving quality.

![Epics Platform](/news/2024/03/12/EpicsPlatformEN.jpg)

On the Epics platform, contributions to open-source result in earning card packs
that can be used in the NFT card game "Buidlers Guild". As the type of cards
received varies with the nature of the work (development, investment, or
publicity), it fosters a supportive community where everyone aids in clearing
tasks. Even users who do not play the card game find value in obtaining card
packs due to demand from players, and valuable cards can lead to advantageous
trades on the market, making it a platform enjoyable for all positions.

By focusing on fun and play on the platform, a sustainable open-source
development environment is created, leading to high-quality open-source software
that can address various social issues. This positive cycle is what Epics DAO
strives to achieve.

We look forward to your participation. For more details, please check the
official Discord.
