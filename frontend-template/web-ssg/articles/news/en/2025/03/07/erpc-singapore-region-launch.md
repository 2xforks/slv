ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands; CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki), provider of the global Solana RPC service ERPC (Solana Enhanced RPC), is pleased to announce the addition of a new **Singapore region**, enhancing performance and addressing increasing demand throughout Asia.

## Background and Purpose of the Singapore Region Expansion

Previously, ERPC's service for the Asian region was exclusively provided from its Tokyo location. However, due to a significant increase in traffic from Singapore and other parts of Asia, we received many requests to further reduce latency and enhance performance across the region.

With the new Singapore region, ERPC will efficiently distribute the load in coordination with the Tokyo region, further reducing latency for Solana network connections throughout Asia.

## Features and Benefits of the Singapore Region

- **High-Speed, High-Power Performance Nodes**  
  The Singapore region features cutting-edge, high-performance nodes capable of reliably handling large volumes and high-frequency requests.

- **Further Latency Reduction Across Asia**  
  Coordinated operations with the Tokyo region will improve overall network performance in Asia. Users in Singapore and Southeast Asia, in particular, will experience significantly faster and more stable connections.

- **Improved Performance of the Existing Tokyo Region**  
  With the traffic now being balanced between multiple regions, the Tokyo region will experience reduced loads, enhancing overall responsiveness and user experience.

## Next Challenge: Establishing the Sydney Region

ELSOUL LABO’s next step is the establishment of a Solana RPC node in Sydney, Australia, responding to strong demand from the community. Due to geographical isolation, setting up Solana validators and expanding the network in Sydney poses technical challenges. Nevertheless, we will leverage our accumulated expertise to provide stable RPC services and extend network coverage.

## Upcoming Enhancements

Additionally, ERPC is currently working on further strengthening gRPC connectivity across all regions. We are configuring and deploying specialized high-performance machines optimized specifically for gRPC traffic. This optimization is expected to further reduce current latencies of 300–400ms, providing the highest level of performance possible.

ELSOUL LABO B.V. remains committed to delivering low-latency, highly reliable Solana network services worldwide, contributing actively to the growth and sustainability of the Web3 ecosystem. We look forward to your continued support and excitement for ERPC’s ongoing development.

Thank you for your continued support.
