## ERPC Endpoint Update Released Simultaneously

Alongside our restock, we've implemented a tune-up update for ERPC endpoints.

### ERPC Update Highlights

- Added new gRPC endpoint in Singapore region
- Improved far-point detection algorithm
- Bug fixes for the Frankfurt region

The new gRPC endpoint in Singapore significantly reduces latency for users in Asia. Additionally, our improved far-point detection algorithm allows IPs previously classified as distant to reconnect to closer nodes by re-registering, enhancing performance. Connection issues in the Frankfurt region have also been resolved.

ELSOUL LABO B.V. remains committed to providing fast and stable infrastructure to the Solana ecosystem. Thank you for your continued support!
