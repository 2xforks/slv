ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, the Netherlands; CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) and the Validators DAO, which works to advance decentralization and security on the Solana network, have announced that their open-source Solana validator tool “SLV” has officially added **Jito MEV Firedancer** support for the Solana mainnet.

By doing so, operators can now leverage **SLV’s core features—“secure remote key management” and “streamlined multi-node operations”—to run Firedancer-based nodes in a simple yet efficient manner**. This makes it easier for newcomers to get started while significantly reducing operational costs for advanced users.

## High-Performance and Reliable Firedancer Support

Jump Crypto’s “Firedancer” Solana validator client is attracting attention for its **C-based, high-efficiency design** and architecture aimed at high throughput. By integrating with SLV, users can benefit from:

- **Automated Firedancer node setup and updates**  
  Greatly reduce complex steps and command operations, enabling stable node operations in a short time.
- **Centralized management of multiple nodes**  
  Easily switch to a spare node in the event of node failure or perform node rotation with minimal effort.
- **Secure remote key management**  
  Since private keys are not stored on the node, risks are minimized in the event of hardware failures or unauthorized access.

These functions combine to lower the barrier for adopting Firedancer while streamlining day-to-day operations, **cutting both time and costs for everyone from beginners to advanced users**.

## Support for Jito MEV Firedancer

SLV has also added support for the “Jito MEV Firedancer” Solana client, developed by Jito Labs. Operators can safely and conveniently deploy and manage Jito MEV Firedancer through SLV.

- **Initial setup and upgrades for Jito MEV Firedancer**  
  SLV supports automated builds and version switching through simple commands.
- **Suitable for a wide range of operational scales**  
  From small-scale validators to large-scale operations, SLV facilitates efficient management with a unified process.

By offering a more advanced solution, SLV opens new possibilities for experienced operators seeking robust configurations and those planning ahead for future maintenance costs.

## Future Outlook and Evolving Node Operations
