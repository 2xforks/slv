ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands; CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) and Validators DAO—which promotes the decentralization and security of the Solana network—announce a significant service upgrade and price revision for “Validators Solutions,” a service that provides automated Solana validator operations.

## What Is Validators Solutions?

Validators Solutions is a service that **automates validator node setup and update tasks**, allowing users to operate a validator without specialized technical expertise. Proper operation of a validator can lead to rewards, but hardware selection, node construction, and continuous software updates demand advanced knowledge and effort. Validators Solutions aims to lower these barriers, enabling more participants to contribute to network security and decentralization while earning rewards.

## Background of the Price Revision and Service Upgrade

This update and price revision are driven by the goal of providing higher-quality, more sustainable validator operations. The main reasons are as follows:

### 1. Meeting Business-Oriented Demand

Much of the current demand for validator services comes from businesses requiring stable, high-performance operations. Therefore, **Validators Solutions will shift entirely to a business-oriented service model**, greatly enhancing both support infrastructure and service quality.

### 2. Securing High-Quality Hardware

Solana is known for its high-speed blockchain, which requires **powerful machines (including high-quality DDR5 memory and the latest AMD CPUs)**. However, these components are currently in short supply worldwide, making procurement challenging.  
Validators Solutions strengthens vendor negotiations and procurement to ensure the necessary resources, including **performance tuning** for validator and RPC node operations.

### 3. Commitment to Sustainable Validator Operations

Solana actively evolves to achieve mass adoption of blockchain technology, frequently rolling out version upgrades and environment changes that require swift response from validators.  
In line with these demands, Validators Solutions continuously updates and improves service quality, supporting clients’ node operations and helping them stay current.
