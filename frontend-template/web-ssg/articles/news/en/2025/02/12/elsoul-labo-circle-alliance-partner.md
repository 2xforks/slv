## Background of ELSOUL LABO’s Selection

ELSOUL LABO has a proven track record in **Solana infrastructure**, particularly in research and development of advanced blockchain technologies. The company has contributed to the overall activation of the Solana ecosystem with offerings such as its **RPC service (ERPC)**, **Validator Solutions**, and **Liquid Staking Token (elSOL)**, leveraging Solana’s high-speed and low-cost advantages.

Meanwhile, Circle leads Web3 infrastructure through its widely adopted and regulation-compliant stablecoins **USDC** and **EURC**. Solana is a notable chain for USDC, highlighted by its **high throughput and low transaction fees**, fueling a variety of compelling business use cases.

Recognizing the potential synergy between **ELSOUL LABO’s Solana-focused blockchain expertise** and **Circle’s global stablecoin payment infrastructure**, the Circle Alliance Program has officially selected ELSOUL LABO as a member, aiming to further expand next-generation internet financial systems.

## ELSOUL LABO’s Key Initiatives

### 1. Solana Blockchain Infrastructure

- **ERPC (Solana Enhanced RPC)**  
  A robust network of over 300 edge servers worldwide provides low-latency, high-reliability node access. Suitable for large-scale traders and high-frequency trading (HFT).

- **Validator Solutions (Automated Solana Validator Management)**  
  An automated solution for validator operations, significantly lowering the technical barriers to entry and enabling more participants to support network security and decentralization.

- **elSOL (Solana Incentivized LST)**  
  A Liquid Staking Token (LST) combining staking rewards with additional incentives. By integrating with DeFi, it improves capital efficiency for investors and projects.

### 2. Open-Source Software Development

- **solv (Solana Validator Tool)**  
  An open-source Solana validator operation tool. It centralizes node setup, monitoring, and updates, reducing complexity and enhancing network decentralization and security.

- **Skeet (Edge-Native Web Framework)**  
  A framework that unifies backend and frontend development. After deployment, services scale across global edge servers for high-speed responses. Web3 features are also easy to integrate.

- **SLV (Integrated Solana Toolchain)**  
  By leveraging the synergy between solv and Skeet, SLV offers an all-in-one environment for seamless validator and Solana application setup and operations. Future plans include “SLV Cloud,” a Solana-focused global edge data center aiming for the fastest possible Solana connectivity.

### 3. DAO Projects

- **Epics DAO**  
  A DAO that merges NFT card gaming with open-source software support. Players can enjoy the game while supporting OSS development through a novel incentive model.

- **Validators DAO**  
  A community focused on sharing knowledge about validator operations, working to improve Solana’s decentralization and security globally.

## Expected Benefits of Joining the Circle Alliance Program

1. **Creating New USDC/EURC × Solana Use Cases**  
   Develop payment solutions and DeFi services that leverage USDC/EURC on Solana’s high-speed, low-cost network, accelerating novel use cases for global markets.

2. **Enhancing Cross-Chain Payment Infrastructure**  
   By integrating Circle’s cross-chain remittance technology and global network with ELSOUL LABO’s multi-region edge infrastructure, the alliance aims to build a more scalable payment and remittance system.

3. **Global Partnership Opportunities**  
   Engaging in collaborative projects with major financial institutions and other Web3 companies within the Circle Alliance Program will further drive the practical adoption of blockchain.

4. **Marketing and Branding**  
   Listing in the Circle Alliance Directory boosts global recognition among investors, developers, and enterprises. Partnerships with DAO and open-source communities also enhance awareness of new services.

## Future Outlook

As a Circle Alliance Program partner, ELSOUL LABO will simultaneously strengthen **the stablecoin-focused blockchain ecosystem** and **its Solana infrastructure**. By combining an open-source development approach with a DAO model, the company aims to accelerate community-driven innovation and establish a sustainable standard for internet finance. Key priorities include:

- **Developing Solutions that Integrate Circle’s Stablecoins**  
  Connect USDC/EURC natively with core infrastructure such as ERPC and SLV Cloud, enabling instant transfers and payments in blockchain applications.

- **Implementing a Global Edge Data Center for High-Speed Data Processing**  
  By distributing servers worldwide, ELSOUL LABO will optimize transactions and settlements on Solana. Planned “SLV Cloud” services will offer a cutting-edge Web3 environment accessible to all.

- **Strengthening Open-Source Communities and Social Impact through DAOs**  
  Projects like Epics DAO and Validators DAO will form an ecosystem that merges social contribution and open-source software support with gaming and staking, balancing entertainment and social good.

Guided by the belief in **the potential of blockchain and open-source software to foster sustainable innovation**, ELSOUL LABO will continue to invest in research, development, and ecosystem growth. By leveraging the global network and expertise gained through the Circle Alliance Program, the company aims to build new economic infrastructure and advance a community-driven ecosystem.
