ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, the Netherlands; CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) is pleased to announce that the company’s global Solana-focused RPC service, **ERPC (Solana Enhanced RPC)**, has successfully carried out a major infrastructure upgrade, resulting in a **significant reduction in latency**. By migrating to a new architecture that enables multiple nodes to operate in a more efficient, coordinated manner, ERPC has evolved into a robust platform capable of handling rapid increases in user numbers and traffic while maintaining stable performance.

## Background and Impact of the New Infrastructure Migration

- **Enhanced Capacity for Large-Scale Traffic**  
  ERPC processes over 2 million requests per day worldwide. Under the new architecture, multiple nodes efficiently distribute the workload, ensuring consistently low latency even under high-traffic conditions.

- **Achieving an Additional 50% Reduction in Latency**  
  Following the migration, the global average response time is approximately 16ms. Compared to existing shared Solana RPC services—which have an average response time of around 60–70ms—this represents about a fourfold improvement.

- **Coordinated Architecture Across All Regions**  
  Designed to optimize network performance across regions, the newly implemented architecture ensures a scalable and stable communication environment even during rapid surges in access. Strengthening regional nodes and deploying high-performance proxies further enhance overall performance.

## Key Highlights of the Architecture

- **Rust-Based High-Performance Proxy**  
  By transitioning to a cutting-edge Rust-based proxy framework that significantly boosts individual node processing power, ERPC achieves higher resource efficiency and improved overall network availability, particularly under heavy traffic loads.

- **Distributed Design for High Availability**  
  Nodes in Europe (Frankfurt, Amsterdam), North America (New York, Chicago), and Asia (Tokyo) operate in a coordinated manner. This setup automatically selects the optimal route for each request, ensuring greater stability and availability than ever before.

- **Further Enhancements on the Horizon**  
  Beyond cutting latency, ERPC will continue to develop and implement optimizations and additional features to handle sudden traffic spikes, strengthen fault tolerance, and more. As a backbone for various use cases—including DeFi, NFTs, and GameFi—ERPC remains committed to ongoing evolution.

## Future Outlook

With this extensive infrastructure overhaul, ERPC now boasts a **global average response time of 16ms**. Going forward, we will continue expanding our research, development, and network to provide even more customers with a high-performance service.

As a globally distributed, ultra-low-latency RPC infrastructure contributing to the Solana ecosystem, ERPC will maintain high stability and availability across regions and use cases.
