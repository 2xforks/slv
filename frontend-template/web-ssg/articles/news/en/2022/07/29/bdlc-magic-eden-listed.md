## Buidlers Collective GENESIS (BDLCG)

[Buidlers Collective (BDLC) GENESIS](https://buidlers.epics.dev/ja/genesis/) is
a randomly generated 1000 28x28 pixel NFT collection on the Solana blockchain.
Each Buidler is unique and has different types and attributes of different
rarity.

The other day, the Mint Gacha System on the website sold out a limited number of
1000 pieces overnight.

As a result, we were able to list on [Magic Eden](https://magiceden.io/),
Solana's largest NFT exchange.

Although it has just been listed and the price is not high, we are confident
that it will have a synergistic effect as we build a decentralized crowdsourcing
platform.

## Decentralized Crowdsourcing Platform

![Epics](/news/2022/07/19/EpicsBusinessModelEN.png)

We are using Solana blockchain network to build a "Decentralized Crowdsourcing
Platform" for open source software development.

Open source software is now an integral part of almost every company due to
innovation, but it's free to use.

Today, quite a few engineers continue to improve open source software, but only
a handful of them are rewarded, and most engineers continue to develop at the
expense of leisure and strength.

On the other hand, corporate engineers cannot devote all their resources to
development. Good development resources are being used to recruit organizations.
There is an engineering resource mismatch for the development we really need.

There is an overwhelming shortage of engineering resources to meet the
ever-increasing quantitative and qualitative demand for open source software.

We solve this problem by building a Decentralized Crowdsourcing Platform and
providing appropriate incentives for open source software development.

Increase the speed and quality of open source software development by creating
an ecosystem where more engineers can participate in and reward open source
software problem solving, and all organizations benefit from software
development.
