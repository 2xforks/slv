## What has Web3 (blockchain) changed?

In a blockchain-powered Web3 world, each user will have their data securely
encrypted. Until now, you registered an account with various apps, and each app
held your data. Apps have relatively free access to your information, and they
can delete it or even deliberately keep you from using their services. Also, if
there is a security incident with your registered app, your data may be exposed.
In Web3 apps (blockchain apps), users keep their data in their own crypto
wallets. dApps (decentralized applications) no longer need to hold user
information, making security incidents much less likely. Since user data is
spread across different crypto wallets, malicious attackers will no longer be
able to obtain as many lists at once as they used to.

## Don't trust. Verify.

Blockchain also advocates a trustless future, as represented by the slogan
"Don't trust. Verify." For example, about one-third of people in India do not
have a family register and cannot open a bank account. Web3 can also be a means
to help people who cannot be helped by today's trust-based finance. De-Fi
(decentralized finance) uses tokens, crypto wallets and smart contracts to
represent financial products. Anyone can create a crypto wallet, and anyone who
holds a crypto wallet can use De-Fi.

## New community and innovation

NFTs and governance tokens (virtual currencies) are creating new communities. By
using these and smart contracts, ownership and contracts of stocks, currencies,
and data can be expressed on the blockchain. For example, anyone can have the
opportunity to launch a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) and raise
funds using tokens, or to use the NFT collection for branding to increase
community value. Now We are living in a world where people can express their
ideas for innovation in their own way, win peopleâ€™s empathy, and work together
to realize them.
