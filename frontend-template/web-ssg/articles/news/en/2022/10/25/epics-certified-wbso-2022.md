ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam) announced that the Epics platform has
been accredited as an Advanced Science and Technology Research and Development
Project (WBSO) by the Dutch government.

## WBSO (Research and Development Tax System)

WBSO encourages research and development (R&D). Thanks to WBSO, the costs are
greatly reduced. For example, you may receive partial reimbursement of wage
costs for certified projects, deductions for other expenses, and tax benefits on
profits from certified projects.

There are various conditions to be certified as a WBSO project. The main ones
are:

- Develop new software, (tangible) products or production processes yourself, or
  carry out technical scientific research.
- Research and development projects take place within the European Union.
- Use a systematic approach to your R&D activities, for example by using
  multiple project phases.
- Your company pays income tax and/or payroll tax.
- Research and development activities have not yet been completed. Only for
  future work can be applied to the WBSO.

Epics was able to receive WBSO R&D project certification as a new decentralized
crowdsourcing platform leveraging Web3's token economy.

## Epics - Decentralized Crowdsourcing Platform

![Epics](/news/2022/07/19/EpicsBusinessModelEN.png)

Epics is a decentralized crowdsourcing platform for incentivizing open source
software development.

Clients can set up a GitHub issue as a Quest (Smart Contract). Developers can
receive token prizes by solving issues (quests).

This ecosystem makes developers focus on problems in their expertise. Also,
clients will be able to solve more advanced problems.

The more token prizes, the more attention to be solved issues. As a result, open
source software grows faster in quality.

Epics solves resource imbalances in software development.

For developers, we can realize a world where they can fully demonstrate and
develop their expertise, and for clients, we can realize a world where open
source software can be used more safely.

We will realize further development of open source software as a more reliable
and high-quality software asset.

Epics DAO was founded to incentivize open source software development.

Open source software has grown rapidly and is now the core of innovation in
software companies. The developments are in a situation where there are not
enough resources available.

However, for further development, from solving problems such as bug fixes, to
improving documentation and support, etc. We are in need of resources now more
than ever.

On the other hand, the developers have a great admiration for a lifestyle where
they can live by committing to open source software. Many developers prefer to
focus all their time on what they are good at if possible.

By creating an ecosystem that incentivizes open source software development with
the Epics platform, We solve resource imbalances and contribute to the further
development of software development sites around the world.
