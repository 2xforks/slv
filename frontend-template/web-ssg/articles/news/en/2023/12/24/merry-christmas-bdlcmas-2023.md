## About Epics DAO

![Epics Platform NFT Card Game](/news/2023/12/01/EpicsPlatformEN.png)

In recent years, fundamentally free high-quality open-source software has grown
to be adopted by 97% of companies. However, many projects are volunteer-driven,
leading to funding difficulties and a lack of resources, often resulting in
inadequate maintenance. As a result, more than half of the software worldwide
faces serious security risks.

The Epics platform integrates three crucial resources for projects -
development, funding, and PR - in a new way. This platform facilitates
collaboration among community members with different roles such as developers,
investors, and PR activists. The goal is to strengthen support for open-source
software development, achieve sustainable development, global software security,
and further improve quality.

The new economic system implemented by Epics in society provides different coin
rewards based on users' methods of contribution (development, investment, public
relations). The types of NFT cards you can earn also vary by job, creating an
environment where users with different roles support each other's achievements.
Everyone can enjoy obtaining and opening card packs, trading cards and packs on
the market, and participating in tournaments as much as they like.

Playing and enjoying on the platform creates a sustainable environment for
open-source development and contributes to solving social issues. That's the
commitment of Epics DAO. Everyone can participate in various ways in this
endeavor. For more details, please visit our official website.
