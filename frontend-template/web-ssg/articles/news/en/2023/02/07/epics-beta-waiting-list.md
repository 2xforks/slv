Epics DAO announced the opening of the Epics Beta waiting list.

## Epics Beta Waiting List

Epics DAO hopes to harness the power of gamification to solve real-world
problems and make everyday work more enjoyable. We believe that blockchain
technologies such as Web3's token economy and NFTs have finally paved the way
for 'Work as a game'.

On the current Epics platform, if you stake an NFT called Buidlers Collective,
you can earn $EPCT to earn rewards which is related their NFT rarity. Also, you
can get their next NFT Mint ticket from the gacha that you can draw for free
every day.

In Epics Beta, we will incorporate game elements more seriously and transform it
into a platform that can be enjoyed by all developers (Dev), clients (Client),
and supporters (Degen).

Epics DAO has opened a waiting list for those who want to try the Epics Beta
game environment as soon as possible.

If you are interested, we would appreciate it if you could participate in this
opportunity.

## Open source development is facing a serious resource shortage as it becomes more important every day

![Market Trends](/news/2023/01/23/MarketTrends.png)
![Problem](/news/2023/01/23/Problem.png)

In 2022, 78% of all codebases were open source software.

In this 12 years, the use of open source software in the software development
field has suddenly become an industry standard.

It's no exaggeration to say that open source software is essential to modern
innovation.

However, since contributions to open source development are still basically free
of charge, open source development is causing a serious shortage of resources as
the importance of open source software increases day by day.

On the other hand, there are many developers who want to devote their lives to
open source software development.

We Epics DAO are working to solve this resource imbalance problem with the power
of Web3 token economy and gamification.

## Epics - Decentralized Crowdsourcing Platform

![Epics](/news/2022/07/19/EpicsBusinessModelEN.png)

Epics is a decentralized crowdsourcing platform for incentivizing open source
software development.

Clients can set up a GitHub issue as a Quest (Smart Contract). Developers can
receive token prizes by solving issues (quests).

This ecosystem makes developers focus on problems in their expertise. Also,
clients will be able to solve more advanced problems.

The more token prizes, the more attention to be solved issues. As a result, open
source software grows faster in quality.

Epics solves resource imbalances in software development.

For developers, we can realize a world where they can fully demonstrate and
develop their own skills, and for clients, we can realize a world where they can
develop higher quality open source software and use open source software more
safely.

We contribute to the development of open source software as a more reliable,
high-quality global software asset.
