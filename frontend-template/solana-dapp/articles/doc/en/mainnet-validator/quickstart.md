## Introduction

To deploy a Solana mainnet validator, you'll use the SLV command-line tool.
This quickstart guide explains how to launch and deploy a mainnet validator spare.
SLV mainnet validators support `keyless operation`.
No sensitive information is stored within the validator node.

You must have Ubuntu 24.04 LTS clean installed on your server.

### Bare Metal Server Preparation

Solana officially recommends using bare metal servers.
Bare metal servers provide higher performance than other virtualized environments.
Solana nodes have high CPU and memory requirements. Typically, a minimum of 24 CPU cores and 384 GB of memory is required.
For stable earnings, 768 GB or more of memory is recommended.

When you run the `slv v init` command, you'll be asked if you already have a bare metal server set up.

```bash
➜  .slv slv v init
? Select Solana Network (testnet) › mainnet
? 🛡️ Do you have a Solana Node Compatabile Server? (no)
❯ yes
  no
```

We'll proceed with the `yes` tutorial here.
If you haven't set up a bare metal server yet, select `no`.
Please refer to this [guide](/en/doc/metal/quickstart) to secure a bare metal server.

## Deploy Solana Mainnet Jito Validator

This command will prompt you to provide necessary information to deploy.

New SLV Deployment is always use `unstaked-keypair.json` for the identity key.
This is the best practice to avoid double voting, and etc.

So Please make sure to set the authorized identity key with `slv v set:identity`
after the deployment.

### Select the Solana Network

Select the Solana Network you want to deploy.

```bash
slv v init
? Select Solana Network (mainnet)
  testnet
❯ mainnet
```

### Input Server's Default Username

Most of the time, the default username is `ubuntu`.

```bash
? What's the user for the server? (ubuntu) › ubuntu
```

### Input Server's IP Address

Input the IP address of the server.

```bash
? What's the IP address of the server? ›
```

### Set RSA Key for SSH

※ Please set the path to your RSA key. The default path is `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
Currently, only the default path is supported.

```bash
? What's the path to your RSA key? (~/.ssh/id_rsa) › ~/.ssh/id_rsa
🔍 Checking SSH connection...
✔︎ SSH connection succeeded
```

Then SLV will check the connection to the server. If the connection is
successful, the next step will be prompted.

### Set the solv user password

Please set the password for the `solv` user of the server.

**8 characters or more, including numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters**

```bash
? Please enter your password › *********
? Please confirm your password › *********
✔︎ Password saved to ~/.slv/config.pwd.yml
```

Encrypted password will be saved to `~/.slv/config.pwd.yml`.

### Select Solana Validator Type

Select the type of Solana validator.

```bash
? Select Validator Type (jito)
❯ jito
```

※ Currently, only Jito validator is supported.

### Set Commission Rate

Set the commission rate for your validator.
※ 1000 equals 10%.

```bash
? Enter Commission Bps (1000) › 1000
```

### Set Relayer URL

Enter the Relayer URL.

```bash
? Enter Relayer URL (http://localhost:11226) › http://localhost:11226
```

### Set Relayer Account

Enter the Relayer Account.

```bash
? Enter Relayer Account(Optional) () › xxxxxxxxxxxPubkeyxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Set Staked RPC Identity (Optional)

Enter the Staked RPC Identity.
If you don't have a specific setting, press Enter to skip.

```bash
? Enter Staked RPC Identity(Optional) () ›
```

### Set Snapshot URL (Optional)

Enter the Snapshot URL.
If you don't have a specific setting, press Enter to skip.

```bash
? Enter Snapshot URL(Optional) () › http://
```

### Generate or Set the Solana Validator Identity

You can generate a new identity key or set an existing identity key. This
example shows how to set an existing identity key.

```bash
? Do you want to create a new identity key now? (Y/n) › No
? Please Enter Your Identity Public Key › EjDwu2Czy8eWEYRuNwtjniYks47Du3KNJ6JY9rs3aFSV
⚠️ Please place your identity key in

  ~/.slv/keys/EjDwu2Czy8eWEYRuNwtjniYks47Du3KNJ6JY9rs3aFSV.json
.
.
✔︎ Success
✔ Inventory updated to ~/.slv/inventory.yml
✔ Successfully created solv user on x.x.x.x
```

Please place your identity key in `~/.slv/keys/<your-pubkey>.json`.
※ This key is not copied into the node, but is needed to later change to an authorized identity key.

Then, SLV will create the solv user with your password.

### Generate or Set the Solana Vote Account

You can generate a new vote account key or set an existing vote account key.
This example shows how to set an existing vote account key.

```bash
? Do you want to create a new vote account key now? (Y/n) › No
? Please Enter Your Vote Account Public Key > <your-vote-account>
```

### Set Your Authority Public Key

Please input your authority public key. This key is used to withdraw rewards
from the vote account.

```bash
? Please Enter Your Vote Account's Authority Key › <your-authority-pubkey>
✔︎ Validator mainnet config saved to ~/.slv/inventory.mainnet.validators.yml

Now you can deploy with:

$ slv v deploy -n mainnet
```

Now your configuration is saved to `~/.slv/inventory.mainnet.validators.yml`.

### Set UFW Firewall

The UFW firewall is configured to allow SSH connections only from specific IP addresses.
To add to the existing whitelist, select `Keep and add more`.

```bash
🔒 Updating Allowed SSH IPs for mainnet_validators

Current Allowed SSH IPs:
  - x.x.x.x
  - x.x.x.x
? What would you like to do with the current IPs?
❯ Keep and add more
  Replace all
  Keep as is
```

Next, enter the IP addresses that are allowed to connect to the node.

```bash
🔒 Updating Allowed IPs for mainnet_validators

Current Allowed IPs:
  - x.x.x.x
  - x.x.x.x
? What would you like to do with the current IPs?
❯ Keep and add more
  Replace all
  Keep as is
```

This completes the firewall configuration.
To update the whitelist later, run the following command:

```bash
slv v update:allowed-ips
```

### Deploy the Validator

Once you confirm the configuration, the deployment will start.

```bash
slv v deploy -n mainnet -p elsoul-spare

It's done! Your Solana Validator is now deployed. It will take some time to
catch up with the Solana network.

Next, you need to change the identity key from the unstaked key to the
authorized identity key.

### Change the Identity Key

After the deployment, you need to change the identity key from the unstaked key to the authorized identity key.

```bash
slv v set:identity -n mainnet --pubkey <your-identity-pubkey>
```

This command will change the identity key to the authorized identity key.

※ For no-downtime migration, please refer to this [guide](/running-validator/validator-migration).
