## Epics DAO's NFT Card Packs Listed on Magic Eden and Tensor

We are excited to announce that the "Buidlers Guild Alpha" NFT card packs from
Epics DAO have been listed on major Solana blockchain NFT marketplaces, Magic
Eden, and Tensor.

"Buidlers Guild Alpha" is the first card pack for the competitive NFT card game
"Buidlers Guild" by Epics DAO, featuring a lineup worthy of the first pack,
limited to 5,000 packs.

In the near future, these packs can be opened on the Epics platform in a "Pack
Opening Ceremony" (Coming Soon), allowing you to acquire cards and build your
decks. The types of cards obtainable vary depending on the type of card pack.

On the platform, card packs tailored to each job are readily available, making

jobs. It is also possible to sell your job's card packs and purchase those from
other jobs.

The "Buidlers Guild Alpha" card packs are currently available on the Epics

## BDLC NFT's Floor Price Reaches All-Time High

![BDLC ATH](/news/2024/02/13/BDLCFPATH.jpg)

The floor price of BDLC (Buidlers Collective) NFTs has surpassed 1.8 SOL (≈
$200), achieving an all-time high (ATH).

Thank you always for your support.

Development is currently focused on the BDLC staking feature.

As a special advance notice, we'd like to briefly explain the rules for BDLC
staking. Those who read this article early are in luck.

BDLC NFTs can now be staked in support of open-source projects.

Staking rewards accumulate every 24 hours, equivalent to the NFT's Total Rarity
x 1 in $EPCT and Investor coins (ownership check and calculation are performed
every 2 hours).

Rewards can be claimed at any time, though a small fee applies (0.001 SOL). At
the time of claiming, an equivalent amount of $EPCT to the rewards will be sent
to the open-source project's multisig treasury, and the staker will be recorded
on the chain as a donor to the project.

There are also part bonuses for this staking, currently revealed as follows:

- Rainbow Part - $EPCT reward bonus of Total Rarity x2
- Pipe - $EPCT reward bonus of Total Rarity x1.5
- Alien - $EPCT reward bonus of Total Rarity x1.5
- VR - $EPCT reward bonus of Total Rarity x1.5

## About Epics DAO

![Epics Plaform NFT Card Game](/news/2023/12/01/EpicsPlatformEN.png)

In recent years, high-quality open-source software, provided mostly for free,
has been adopted by 97% of companies. However, many projects are
volunteer-driven, leading to funding and resource shortages that often result in
inadequate maintenance. As a result, more than half of the world's software is
at serious security risk.

The Epics platform integrates three crucial resources for projects: development,
funding, and PR, in a new way. This platform promotes collaboration among
community members with different roles, such as developers, investors, and
public relations activists. The goal is to strengthen support for open-source
software development, ensuring sustainable development, global software
security, and further quality improvement.

Epics introduces a new economic system that provides different coin rewards
based on the user's contribution method (development, investment, PR), offering
various NFT cards according to the job. This environment encourages users with
different roles to support each other's achievements. Users can enjoy obtaining
and opening card packs, trading cards and packs in the market, and participating
in competitions as they like.

Playing and enjoying on the platform creates a sustainable open-source
development environment and contributes to solving social issues, realizing a
virtuous cycle. This is the effort of Epics DAO. Everyone can cooperate in
various ways in this initiative. We look forward to your participation. For more
details, please check the official Discord.
