## About Epics DAO

![Epics Platform NFT Card Game](/news/2023/12/01/EpicsPlatformEN.png)

In recent years, high-quality open-source software, which is fundamentally free,
has grown to be adopted by 97% of companies. However, many projects are
volunteer-driven, leading to financial difficulties and a lack of resources,
often resulting in inadequate maintenance. As a result, over half of the
software worldwide faces serious security risks.

The Epics platform integrates three crucial resources for projects: development,
funding, and PR, in a new way. This platform fosters collaboration among
community members with different roles, such as developers, investors, and
publicists. Its goal is to enhance the support for open-source software
development, ensure sustainable development and global software security, and
further improve quality.

The new economic system implemented by Epics offers different coin rewards based
on user contribution methods (there are three types of jobs: development,
investment, publicity). The type of NFT card you can acquire also varies
depending on the job, creating an environment where users with different roles
can support each other's achievements. Everyone can enjoy obtaining and opening
card packs, trading cards and packs on the market, and participating in
tournaments as they please.

Playing and enjoying on the platform creates a sustainable open-source
development environment and contributes to solving social issues. That is the
initiative of Epics DAO. Everyone can cooperate in various ways in this
initiative. We eagerly await your participation. For more information, please
check the official Discord.
