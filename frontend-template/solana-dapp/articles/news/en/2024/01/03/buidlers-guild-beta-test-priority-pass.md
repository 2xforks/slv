ELSOUL LABO B.V. (ELSOUL LABO, headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO:
Fumitake Kawasaki) and its initiative for supporting open-source development
through social contribution in Web3 games, Epics DAO, have announced the Mint
plan for the β test priority pass of the Solana NFT card game.

## About the Solana NFT Card Game β Test Priority Pass

The Mint for the β test priority pass of the NFT card game will soon commence on
the Epics platform.

In both this NFT card game and the priority pass, the new technology of Solana's
Compressed NFT has been adopted. This compression technology reduces costs,
allowing for a larger number of items to be handled as NFTs. By tokenizing items
as NFTs, users can own them and enjoy trading on the NFT marketplace. This
expands the enjoyment of the platform in a multifaceted manner.

Holders of this priority pass will be able to participate in the β test of the
main content of this platform, the NFT card game, and will receive limited
edition cards, items, and many other benefits.

The following users can obtain the priority pass for free through free mint:

- Winners from last year's Epics Beta waitlist
- White list users who participated in AMA held by Solana Japan
- Buidlers Collective NFT holders (snapshot coming soon)
- Epics Alpha users

The free mint qualification is only valid for addresses registered on the
platform, so please register your Solana wallet on the following URL.
Registration is completed just by logging in.

## About Epics DAO

![Epics Platform NFT Card Game](/news/2023/12/01/EpicsPlatformEN.png)

In recent years, high-quality open-source software, essentially free, has been
adopted by 97% of companies. However, many projects are volunteer-driven,
leading to funding difficulties and a lack of resources, often resulting in
inadequate maintenance. As a result, over half of the software worldwide faces
serious security risks.

The Epics platform integrates three crucial resources for projects: development,
funding, and PR in a new way. The platform fosters collaboration among community
members with different roles such as developers, investors, and PR activists.
The goal is to strengthen support for open-source software development, ensuring
sustainable development and global software security while improving quality
further.

The new economic system implemented by Epics provides different coin rewards
based on the user's contribution method (development/investment/PR with three
job types). The type of NFT cards that can be acquired also varies by job,
creating an environment where users with different roles support each other's
achievements. Everyone can enjoy obtaining and opening card packs, trading cards
and packs on the market, and participating in tournaments as they like.

Playing and enjoying on the platform creates a virtuous cycle that builds a
sustainable open-source development environment and addresses social issues.
That's the initiative of Epics DAO. Everyone can participate in this initiative
in various ways. Your support is very welcome. For more details, please check
the official Discord.
