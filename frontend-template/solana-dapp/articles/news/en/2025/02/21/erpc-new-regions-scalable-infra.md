ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, The Netherlands; CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) is pleased to announce a significant global-scale expansion of its Solana-focused RPC service, **ERPC (Solana Enhanced RPC)**. We have added **Frankfurt (Germany)** and **Chicago (USA)** as new node locations, and have further enhanced our high-performance nodes in **New York**, **Amsterdam**, and **Tokyo**, resulting in a more scalable and robust infrastructure than ever before.

## What is ERPC (Solana Enhanced RPC)?

Developed by ELSOUL LABO B.V., **ERPC** is an RPC/gRPC service that seamlessly connects the **Solana blockchain** with various applications. By leveraging **over 300 edge servers** deployed worldwide, ERPC routes user requests via the most optimal path, delivering low-latency and highly reliable communication from any region.

Its high-speed and stable performance has garnered strong support from traders handling large-scale trading flows or high-frequency transactions. ERPC helps process transactions on Solana smoothly, supporting stable operations for decentralized applications (dApps).

## Major Expansion with New Regions and Existing Node Upgrades

This release adds **Frankfurt** and **Chicago** as new ERPC node regions, significantly strengthening network coverage in Europe and North America. As a result, more users can experience low-latency, stable connections from these regions.  
In addition, our high-performance nodes in **New York**, **Amsterdam**, and **Tokyo** have been expanded on a large scale, establishing a robust infrastructure ready to handle further increases in traffic.

- **Frankfurt Region**: A key European communication hub providing high-speed access from major cities
- **Chicago Region**: An essential region supporting trading demands in North America, optimizing connections throughout the U.S. Midwest and Canada
- **New York, Amsterdam, and Tokyo Node Upgrades**: Enhanced processing capabilities and resources for existing nodes, enabling stable connections even under heavy load

## Performance Improvements through New Infrastructure Upgrades

Alongside this expansion, the ERPC platform infrastructure has been upgraded. We have further strengthened the collaborative framework of high-performance nodes across multiple regions, ensuring low latency even under concurrent high-load conditions across several locations.

- **Transition to a Rust-Based High-Performance Proxy**  
  Replacing the previous proxy setup with a new Rust-based system has tripled the processing performance of individual nodes
- **Scalable and Robust Network Architecture**  
  Adding new nodes and optimizing existing ones achieves both high availability and resilience

## Future Outlook

ELSOUL LABO B.V. will continue to expand its edge data centers to enhance the decentralization and performance of the Solana network globally.

In particular, the ultra-low-latency environment offered by ERPC is an essential element for various use cases, such as DeFi, NFTs, and GameFi. We plan to further strengthen this foundation that supports the growth of the entire ecosystem.
