**ELSOUL LABO B.V.** (Headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands; CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) is pleased to announce the official launch of our **Zero-block Latency Solana Premium RPC** under our distributed infrastructure service **ERPC (Enhanced Solana RPC)**, coming in **March 2025**. We have now started **accepting reservations**. By providing near real-time data streaming (within approximately 400ms of the latest network block) and transaction submission capabilities, we aim to meet the time-critical operational needs of traders, DeFi users, and other latency-sensitive projects.

## Background: Why Zero-block Latency Solana Premium Nodes?

Demand for **low-latency data retrieval and transactions of about 400ms** has recently surged, particularly among traders. In volatile market conditions, even minor network delays can result in significant missed opportunities.

Solana inherently requires high-clock-speed CPUs, and maintaining **zero-block latency** calls for not only rigorous software optimization, but also the world’s fastest processors. Such hardware is in short supply worldwide, making reliable procurement a formidable challenge.

Recognizing these hurdles, ELSOUL LABO has successfully **expanded its procurement network** to secure ultra-high-clock-speed CPUs, ensuring a stable supply of **Zero-block Latency Premium Nodes**. This enables **same-block data retrieval and transaction submission**, offering a decisive advantage and accommodating even the most demanding use cases.

We are initially **accepting reservations** for **New York** and **Amsterdam**, and plan to extend availability based on future demand.

## Key Features

- **Ultra-Low Latency (~400ms)**  
  Ideal for traders and DeFi users who require fast, accurate order placement and transaction processing.

- **World-Class High-Clock-Speed CPUs**  
  Capitalizes on top-tier hardware resources to significantly boost transaction throughput on the Solana network.

- **Advanced Software Optimization and Tuning**  
  Leveraging our expertise in open-source software and service development, we have tailored each node for zero-block Latency while preserving stability and performance.

- **Reservations Now Open Ahead of the March 2025 Launch**  
  Due to anticipated high demand, we may halt reservations once capacity is reached. We recommend early registration to guarantee a slot.

## Benefits for Shared RPC/gRPC Environments

These Premium Nodes will not be restricted to an exclusive audience; rather, they will help **optimize load distribution** across the entire network. As a result, existing **Shared RPC/gRPC** environments are also expected to benefit from enhanced performance. We will continue to refine ERPC to deliver increased speed, reliability, and a seamless user experience for all.

## Future Outlook

Zero-block Latency Premium Nodes provide a substantial advantage to traders and other time-critical applications. ELSOUL LABO remains committed to **expanding its global infrastructure** and **driving leading-edge R&D**, thereby contributing to the growth of both the Solana ecosystem and the broader blockchain landscape. Stay tuned for further developments in ERPC’s ongoing evolution.
