ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands; CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki), in collaboration with Validators DAO, which promotes decentralization and enhanced security of the Solana network, has officially launched an **easy setup feature for Solana Geyser gRPC nodes** in its open-source Solana validator tool, SLV.

Previously, setting up Geyser gRPC on Solana RPC nodes required installing the Yellowstone plugin and performing complex configuration tasks. The new SLV feature enables users to **quickly and effortlessly set up Geyser gRPC nodes through simple interactive prompts**.

## Deploy a Geyser gRPC Node in Just a Few Steps

With the latest version of SLV, users can automatically configure the following by answering simple command-line prompts:

- SSH connection verification
- Automatic generation and management of node identity keys
- Seamless integration with Solana CLI
- Selection of Jito block engine regions (e.g., Frankfurt)
- RPC port configuration
- Selection of RPC type (Geyser gRPC, Index RPC, SendTx RPC, etc.)

This drastically reduces complex tasks and minimizes setup errors, enabling users to complete setups quickly and efficiently.
