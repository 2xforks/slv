ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki), in collaboration with Validators DAO, which promotes decentralization and enhanced security for the Solana network, has released **performance and high-load optimized settings for popular Solana Geyser gRPC streaming use cases** in the open-source Solana validator tool, SLV.

With SLV, the previously complicated and unclear configuration process for Geyser gRPC servers can now be quickly and easily initiated with optimized default settings.

## Optimal Configuration Leveraging ERPC Operational Expertise

We continuously operate ERPC as a Solana RPC provider, accumulating extensive research, development, and operational insights. Additionally, the Validators DAO community regularly provides valuable feedback on gRPC server stability and performance. Leveraging this extensive experience and data, the latest SLV version comes with default settings optimized for maximum performance and high-load resilience for popular use cases.

### Recommended Server Specifications

To effectively operate these optimized settings, we recommend the following server specifications:

- CPU: Minimum 24 cores, 3.8 GHz or higher
- RAM: 384GB or more (DDR5 recommended)

## Addressing Existing User Challenges

Previously, many users experienced downtime and performance degradation due to unclear or suboptimal settings after setting up their Geyser gRPC servers. The new optimized settings provide an ideal solution to address these issues.

We encourage users who previously faced operational difficulties to try the latest SLV version.
