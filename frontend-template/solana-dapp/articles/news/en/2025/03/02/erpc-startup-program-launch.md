ELSOUL LABO B.V. (headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) provides **ERPC (Solana Enhanced RPC)**, a high-speed and stable RPC solution powered by over 300 edge servers worldwide. To further encourage Web3 and Solana development, we are pleased to announce the launch of the **“ERPC Startup Program.”**

## What Is the ERPC Startup Program?

**ERPC (Solana Enhanced RPC)** automatically selects the nearest server to deliver **low-latency, stable connections**. For Solana dApps that demand high performance, ERPC ensures fast access from anywhere in the world.

However, many Web3 and Solana projects face **significant infrastructure costs** when testing or developing at mainnet scale. To address this challenge and help drive the mass adoption of crypto, we’ve launched the **“ERPC Startup Program.”**

### 3 Months of Free Access

Startup projects approved for this program can enjoy **3 months of free access** to the following resources:

- **ERPC Pro Plan**
- **Jupiter Pro Plan**
- **gRPC connections (3 IP addresses)**

Together, these benefits amount to approximately **€7,000 in value** and enable you to test and develop Solana dApps under near-production conditions.

## Program Background

Currently, numerous Web3 and Solana projects are eager to test under conditions close to mainnet or a production-scale environment. However, operating an RPC node capable of handling **high-frequency transactions** without downtime can be both technically challenging and expensive.

At ELSOUL LABO, we have leveraged our **global network of over 300 edge servers** to develop and provide **low-latency, highly available** RPC services through ERPC. By introducing the **ERPC Startup Program**, we aim to **lower the barriers to development and accelerate the emergence of innovative Solana dApps**.

## Future Outlook

ELSOUL LABO B.V. works closely with various Solana-based projects and communities to build a **sustainable and robust Web3 ecosystem**. We hope this ERPC Startup Program will help cultivate the next generation of groundbreaking services on Solana.

Going forward, we will continue to advance solutions like **Validators Solutions** for stable node operations and develop tools such as **SLV (Solana Validator tool)**, making it easier for more people to confidently leverage the Solana network.

We look forward to your continued support.
