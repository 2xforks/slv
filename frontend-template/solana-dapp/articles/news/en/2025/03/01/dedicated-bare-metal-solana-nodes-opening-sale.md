ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, the Netherlands; CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) is pleased to announce the launch of our **bare-metal servers optimized for Solana testnet, mainnet, and RPC**. Drawing on our experience from operating “Validators Solutions” and “ERPC (Enhanced Solana RPC),” we have selected high-spec servers and applied the tuning expertise developed through our open-source tool **SLV (Solana Validator operation tool)**. To mark this release, we are offering a **limited-time opening sale**. With robust performance, even demanding environments can be operated smoothly by both new and experienced users.

## Background: Introducing Tuned Bare-Metal Servers for Solana

While **Solana** is a blockchain known for its high processing speed and scalability, fully leveraging its capabilities requires **high-spec servers featuring high-clock-speed CPUs** and well-tuned software configurations. General cloud servers or systems lacking sufficient resources often encounter issues such as node downtime or slot drops, making it difficult to maintain optimal performance.

Through our work with **SLV**, we have supported numerous Solana node deployments. In many cases, improper hardware configurations or suboptimal initial settings led to elusive malfunctions and repeated outages, making troubleshooting challenging. To address these issues, we thoroughly **evaluate and tune our bare-metal servers** before assigning them for testnet, mainnet, or RPC use—offering an environment tailored to each operational requirement.

## Key Features

- **In-House Tuning Expertise from SLV Development and Operations**  
  We configure each bare-metal server to maximize its potential, ensuring Solana nodes maintain strong processing performance and stable operation.

- **Clearly Labeled Servers for Each Purpose**  
  Servers are categorized by operational intent—testnet, mainnet, or RPC—allowing you to select the optimal configuration without confusion.

- **Resilient Under Heavy Load**  
  Equipped with high-clock CPUs and ample memory, these servers handle peak load periods with minimal performance degradation.

## Opening Sale Details

To commemorate the launch of this service, we are offering the following plans at special prices for a limited time. Since there is a finite number of servers, we encourage early applications.

- **Testnet-Focused Solana Validator Node**  
  Regular Price: €330/month → **Opening Sale: €198/month**

- **Mainnet & RPC-Focused Solana Validator Node**  
  Regular Price: €2150/month → **Opening Sale: €1280/month**
