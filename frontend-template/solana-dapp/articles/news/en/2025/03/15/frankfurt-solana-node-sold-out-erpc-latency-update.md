Our dedicated RPC service, ERPC, has surpassed 10 million daily accesses. Through continued optimizations, we have successfully reduced average latency to approximately 5 milliseconds. This enhancement provides Solana dApp developers with a significantly faster and smoother development environment.

Additionally, dedicated RPC Nodes and Dedicated Zero Block Premium Nodes are expected to be restocked later this month. Currently, we are optimizing node performance and preparing a new pricing structure. Further updates will be announced on our official Discord and website.
