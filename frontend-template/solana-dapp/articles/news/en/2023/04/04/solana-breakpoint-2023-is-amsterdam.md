Solana Breakpoint is the largest annual event with lots of exciting information,
such as the latest trends in the Solana ecosystem and discussions on the Future
of blockchain technology, and many participants are expected. Solana Breakpoint
2022 was held in Lisbon, Portugal, in November, and over 13,000 people attended
the four-day event.

Solana Breakpoint 2023 will be held from October 30th (Monday) to November 3rd
(Friday). On the event day, you can head to the venue by shuttle bus or ferry
from near Amsterdam Central Station. Event attendees can also get flight
discounts from his Solana Breakpoint official website below. It seems that the
announcement of partner hotels that can also receive discounts will be announced
soon.

At last year's Solana Breakpoint 2022, we announced partnerships with Google
Cloud and Meta (Facebook), announced large-scale announcements such as "Solana
Saga Phone," a Web3 mobile scheduled to be released globally shortly, and other
developments in the Solana ecosystemâ€”many new projects and applications were
introduced and received much attention.

At this year's Solana Breakpoint 2023, it is expected that further innovations,
such as Compressed NFT (which can compress NFT transactions to reduce costs
significantly), which is currently attracting attention, will be announced.

We, the Solana community and local hosts, will work together to prepare for this
event, a breakpoint for the entire Solana community.

Thank you for your continued support.
