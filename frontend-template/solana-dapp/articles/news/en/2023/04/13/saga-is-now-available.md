## Saga is Now Available

"Welcome to the future"

Crypto (cryptocurrency/virtual currency) and blockchain experiences are mostly
done on PCs. However, people do not live their lives with PCs in mind, and it is
necessary to fill this gap for mass adoption.

Some users are still working with blockchain on mobile, but their UX, such as
using the browser inside their wallet, has prevented them from going beyond
traditional mobile apps. You also need to trust and deposit your private key
with multiple services. However, in principle, only you should manage your
private key.

"Saga" is the new Web3 smartphone that solves this usability and security
problem.

Saga will start shipping to pre-orders on April 20th and accepting new general
orders from May 8th. Available in the US, EU, UK, Canada, Switzerland,
Australia, and New Zealand.

For a comfortable Web3 experience on mobile, security is required first and
foremost in handling private keys.

In "Saga" your private key is protected with hardware-level supported
encryption. Even Saga Android OS does not have permission to access the private
key.

With passwords and biometrics that only you know, your private keys remain fully
protected and easily accessible only to you.
