Saga Phone (https://solanamobile.com/hardware) is developed by the Solana Mobile
team in the Solana ecosystem under the concept of "Web3 on Mobile".

With specs such as 12G RAM, 512G storage, 50MP rear camera and 16MP front
camera, 6.67 inch display, it also supports fingerprint authentication.

The Web3 smartphone is notable for its built-in Seed Vault, a system that can
safely store important information such as private keys handled by
cryptocurrency wallets.

It is an image of a smartphone equipped with the security function of a hardware
wallet like Ledger (https://www.ledger.com/ja).

The aim is to make the handling of crypto assets safer and more convenient, and
all transactions can be performed with fingerprint authentication.

## Solana dApp Store

The Solana dApp Store is a dApp platform like the App Store on iPhone and the
Play Store on Android, and will be available first on the Saga Phone.

Users can search and download their favorite Solana dApps. The app and wallet
work seamlessly without the need to download any other browser extensions.

In addition, while app platforms usually charge a small fee, the Solana dApp
Store can be used with zero fees.

As the entire ecosystem develops mobile apps and the Web3 experience becomes
more compact, it is expected that he will approach his ideal UX that is easy for
many people to handle.

Epics DAO's decentralized crowdsourcing platform has also started developing
support for his Solana dApp Store and Saga Phone.

## Open source development is facing a serious resource shortage as it becomes more important every day

![Problem](/news/2023/01/23/Problem.png)

In 2022, 78% of all codebases were open source software.

In this 12 years, the use of open source software in the software development
field has suddenly become an industry standard.

It's no exaggeration to say that open source software is essential to modern
innovation.

However, since contributions to open source development are still basically free
of charge, open source development is causing a serious shortage of resources as
the importance of open source software increases day by day.

On the other hand, there are many developers who want to devote their lives to
open source software development.

We Epics DAO are working to solve this resource imbalance problem with the power
of Web3 token economy and gamification.
