Epics DAO adopts gamification as a new approach to solving social challenges,
particularly addressing the complex and often invisible issue of resource
scarcity in open-source development.

By making the actions that contribute to collective value clear through the fun
of gaming, it encourages each individual to play a part in solving social
challenges.

Epics DAO aims to foster long-term collaborative work and strong community
formation through this enjoyable approach.

In this way, Epics DAO offers an environment where social contribution is fun,
reinforcing support for open-source projects and promoting mutual support and
cooperation among participants through gaming.

This innovative initiative elevates Epics beyond a mere game platform, paving a
new path towards sustainable development and the resolution of social
challenges.

## About the Epics Platform NFT Card Game

Recently, high-quality open-source software, essentially free of charge, has
grown to be adopted by 97% of companies. However, many projects, being
volunteer-driven, often lack proper maintenance due to funding and resource
shortages. As a result, over half of the software worldwide faces serious
security risks.

The Epics Platform integrates three key resources for projects - development,
funding, and PR - in a new way. It promotes collaboration among community
members with different roles, such as developers, investors, and PR activists.
The aim is to enhance support for open-source software development, achieving
sustainable development, global software security, and further quality
improvement.

In the new economic system implemented by Epics, users receive different coin
rewards based on their contributions (development/investment/PR). Different
types of NFT card packs are available depending on the job type, creating an
environment where users in different roles support each otherâ€™s achievements. In
this open ecosystem, everyone can enjoy opening card packs, trading in the
market, and participating in competitions.

These innovative features using crypto and NFTs elevate Epics to more than just
a gaming platform, forging a new path for co-creation, empathy, and sustainable
development.

Epics strives to solve challenges of open-source projects, public goods, in a
fun and collaborative manner, working towards a safer and more convenient
society.
