Epics is a Web3 blockchain game (BCG) to incentivize open source software
development.

Players can join Epics and enjoy the game without owning their BDLC NFT; BDLC
NFT holders have various in-game benefits.

BDLC NFT can be used as an AI robot in the Epics game (increase the number of
robots possessed, and the game can be progressed advantageously), and an initial
status bonus and initial skill bonus limited to the NFTs are given, so it is a
unique enhanced AI robot helpful in such as the in-game battle.

You can benefit further by equipping each pattern's parts in the game.

At the same time, parts and skill details have also been announced, so please
check it out.

## Epics - The Buidlers Guild

Epics is a Web3 blockchain game (BCG) to incentivize open source software
development.

80% of the current software (including commercial) source code worldwide is
open. Most software today is based on open-source software. However, open-source
development is free of charge and is not a sustainable environment.

To make open source development sustainable, the existence of capital
(Investor), development resources (Dev), and public relations (Degen) that
inform the current situation and gather collaborators is indispensable. Good
cooperation among these three parties will enable further open-source
development. As open source development develops, the software that depends on
it will benefit, and society will become more convenient.

Epics players first choose their job among Dev, Degen, and Investor. After that,
you can earn many points by doing actions in your specialty (for example, Dev
for development work, Degen for advertising, Investor for investing and donating
to open source projects, and holding bounty programs). Teams with all three
types of jobs collected get preferential status. Both in the game and the real
world, cooperation between developers (Dev), public relations (Degen), and
investors (Investor) is essential. As the game progresses, real-world
open-source problems also will be solved.

Epics aims to create a sustainable open-source development environment powered
by gamification and Web3 token economy. Enthusiasm for the game raises funds,
solves problems such as actual bugs, and allows developers to earn a living by
contributing to open-source development, allowing them to focus more on
development. The virtuous cycle is created. Such a sustainable open-source
development environment will enable more convenient software innovation.
